Messages written in the SLOPI (pronounced "sloppy") communication style are:

- Searchable: Messages can be found using Google or other search engines.
- Linkable: Messages have a permalink on the web.
- Open: Messages are in the open.
- Public: Messages are public.
- Indexed: Messages are indexed by search engines.

This phrasing, especially with regard to messages being searchable and linkable, is inspired by the [discussion][] criteria of [Core Infrastructure Initiative (CII) Best Practices][] program.

Examples of communication tools that support the SLOPI style include:

- mailing lists with public archives
- public forums
- public issue trackers
- Gitter
- IRC channels with public logs
- XMPP rooms with public logs
- public roadmaps
- public kanban boards

(As part of [issue #2][] we are gathering examples in the wild in a [spreadsheet][].)

While open source projects should endeavor to communicate in the SLOPI style whenever possible, this style is inappropriate for security, code of conduct violations, and telling co-workers on your floor that you brought in donuts.

The SLOPI style can take some getting used to if you are new to open source culture. It's ok to be a little sloppy. Please don't worry if the message you send isn't perfect. The fact that you sent it in the open is appreciated. Open source is getting friendlier. A thick skin isn't as necessary as it was in the past.
